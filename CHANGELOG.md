## [0.8.33] - 2026-07-21

### 🚀 Features

- **Harbor Docker Attach**: Harbor Docker trials attach LibrAgent to the existing Compose `main` container (`attachContainer` + `workdir`, usually `/app`) so shell/file tools share the verifier filesystem; host pull/push sync is skipped on that path.
- **Harbor Benchmark Runner**: Added a Harbor / Terminal-Bench adapter and `pnpm bench:*` scripts that spawn Session API runs with `executionMode` (default `unsafe` for unattended hard-approval tools).
- **Session API `executionMode`**: `POST /api/sessions` now accepts `executionMode` (`normal` | `yolo` | `unsafe`) before the initial workflow starts.
- **Flattened `editFile` Anchors**: `editFile` now uses start/end `N:anchor` refs for clearer, flatter line edits.
- **Execution Platform in Workspace Context**: Agents see the current OS/platform in the workspace service context to pick the right shell tools.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Thinking-Only Stuck Turns**: Thinking-only LLM completions no longer stop the workflow as finished — they forward to Rust recovery and retry with the shared thinking retry budget. Content-array thinking is no longer misclassified as renderable output.
- **Harbor Incomplete Harvest**: Harbor agent timeouts no longer harvest workspace/messages as a successful finish; only `idle`/`error` complete a trial. Timeout multipliers are exposed on the bench scripts.
- **Loop Detection Threshold**: Thinking/text loop recovery now requires 3 repetitions before cancel-and-retry, reducing false positives.
- **Cross-Platform Bench Scripts**: `pnpm bench:*` now runs via a Node dispatcher on Windows (PowerShell), Linux, and macOS (bash), instead of requiring PowerShell everywhere.

### 🔧 Internal

- **Docker Attach Config**: `DockerWorkspaceConfig` supports optional `attachContainer` / `workdir` / `manageLifecycle` for attaching to an existing container without creating or destroying it.
- **Assistant Message Shape Helper**: Extracted `inspect_assistant_message_shape` for consistent empty / thinking-only detection.

## [0.8.32] - 2026-07-19

### 🚀 Features

- **Isolation-Aware Shell Tools**: Workspace shell tools (`runShell`, `runPowerShell`, `runInPersistentShell`, `runInPersistentPowerShell`) are now exposed based on the session's workspace isolation mode — Docker sessions get bash/sh tools, Host Windows gets PowerShell only, Host Unix gets bash/sh. Cross-dialect tool calls are rejected with clear guidance.
- **Planning Service — Optional**: The `planning` service is no longer auto-included as a core builtin. It must be explicitly requested via `builtinCapabilities: ["planning"]` when creating agents that need goal/todo management.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Docker on Windows Shell Exposure**: Fixed Docker sessions on Windows hosts not exposing `runShell`/`runInPersistentShell`, which are required since Docker always executes via `docker exec … -lc` (bash/sh).
- **Cross-Dialect Tool Guidance**: Agents now receive actionable error messages when calling platform-incompatible shell tools, with clear suggestions for the correct tool.
- **Circuit Breaker Exemption Cleanup**: Removed a stale `scratchpad__think` loop-detection exemption so repeated failures escalate correctly while preserving `planning__reflect` and `ui__circuitBreak` handling.

### 🔧 Internal

- **Workspace Server Isolation Propagation**: `WorkspaceServer` now reads the session's `workspace_isolation` mode at construction via `MCPServiceProxyFactory`, replacing the previous hardcoded Host assumption.

- **MCP Schema Alignment**: Aligned builtin tool schemas with actual runtime behavior to eliminate tool call failures.
- **Read-Only Tool Hint Suppression**: Agents no longer receive edit suggestions (e.g. `strReplace`) for read-only tools, and fixed a batch loop blind spot.
- **Duplicate Tool Results**: Preserved distinct tool results that happen to have identical content instead of deduplicating them incorrectly.
- **CI Test Mock**: Removed dead `results` field from `builtin_service_registry_tests` mock data.

### 🔧 Internal

- **Compaction Handoff**: Switched compaction to deliverable-first handoff, dropping the previous continue-bias behavior.

## [0.8.30] - 2026-07-15

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Workspace Tool Guidance**: Aligned agent-facing tool descriptions and success hints with actual behavior — clarified two-outcome sync vs timeout-handoff for `runShell`/`runPowerShell`, fixed `process_id` → `processId` consistency, removed misleading "Total Processes" from service context, and corrected wrong tool suggestions (e.g. `listProcesses` no longer suggests `waitForProcess`, `readFile` now correctly points to `strReplace` for edits).
- **Teamwork Write Hardening**: Fixed absolute path write validation for teamwork root, added loop prevention, and hardened atomic writes to prevent corruption.
- **Process Not-Found Guidance**: Improved error messages when process IDs are invalid or missing, with clear next-step hints.
- **Agent Message Persistence**: Awaited database persistence of assistant messages to prevent race conditions on session resume.

## [0.8.27] - 2026-07-10

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Windows External MCP Startup**: Fix intermittent stdio MCP initialize failures (`connection closed: initialize response`) on Windows GUI launches by piping child stderr instead of inheriting a broken console handle under `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`. External `npx` servers (e.g. yahoo-finance, fred) now start reliably.

### 🔧 Internal

- **MCP Spawn Diagnostics & Regression Guard**: Log PATH/command resolution on stdio MCP spawn, forward child stderr into app logs, and add a Windows-safe CI regression test so stderr piping cannot be removed as “logging cleanup.”

## [0.8.26] - 2026-07-09

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Compaction Resume-Fit Split Selection**: When context overflow triggers compaction, choose the deepest ownership-safe split that makes the _next_ live prompt fit—not a shallow checkpoint-seeded split that leaves an oversized retained tail and then fails with `INVALID_CONTEXT_STATE`. Compaction-input fitting may shrink the summarizer payload but must not move the resume boundary (`to_id`).

### 🔧 Internal

- **Compaction Contract Docs & Regression Tests**: Document the resume-fit selection contract in the message-compaction spec/architecture notes and add integration coverage for shallow-checkpoint and payload-boundary regressions.

## [0.8.25] - 2026-07-09

### 🐛 Fixes

Overflow now triggers compaction or returns an explicit error, matching the message-compaction contract.
- **Docker Draft Flow & Error UX**: Improve Docker provisioning / draft chat submit error handling, and prevent Docker error dialog overflow with collapsible details.
- **Path Traversal Hardening**: Fix path traversal issues in secure path resolution and clarify absolute-path rejection error messages.
- **Model Picker Refresh Tooltip**: Make the disabled model-picker refresh control focusable so its tooltip remains accessible.
- **Workspace Edit Clarity**: Clarify edit anchors and line numbers in tool output, remove dead anchor computation from edit diff preview, and drop generic file-tool hints from shell success responses.

### 🔧 Internal

- **Workspace Test Alignment**: Canonicalize temp base dirs for persistent-shell CWD checks and align workspace hash-anchor tests with plain diff output.
- **Bundle Size Budget**: Raise `largestCssBytes` limit to accommodate current CSS bundle size.

## [0.8.24] - 2026-07-06

### 🚀 Features

- **Docker Workspace Isolation**: Implemented Docker workspace isolation (Phases 1-4) with persistent shell, loopback port mapping, path mapping layers, minimal image automatic `sh` fallback, and automatic sweep of stale containers.
- **Docker Isolation UI Settings**: Added simplified Docker isolation workspace settings UI to the draft workspace and chat panels.
- **Recursive Batch Session Model Update**: Added batch update capability for session model/provider on sub-sessions, automatically propagating changes recursively while protecting assistant configurations.

- **Parallel MCP server initialization**: External stdio and HTTP MCP servers are now initialized concurrently using `JoinSet` instead of sequentially. With N servers configured, startup time now equals the slowest single server rather than N × slowest — a significant improvement once you start stacking up MCP servers.

## [0.5.14] - 2026-02-23

### 🚀 Features

- **Compass: Cross-platform terminal & path standardization**: Unified terminal launch and `PATH` environment variable handling across Windows, macOS, and Linux in the Workspace built-in server — eliminating `local_bin` resolution bugs on non-standard setups.
- **Session name previews the request**: Session name generation now incorporates a short preview of the initial user request, making session history far easier to scan at a glance.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`mcp_manager` always enabled**: The `mcp_manager` built-in service was registered as `optional: false` in the registry but absent from `CORE_BUILTIN_SERVICE_ALIASES`, causing agents with an explicit alias list to receive "Built-in server 'mcp_manager' not enabled in this session" errors. Fixed in both the Rust registry array and the TypeScript `ServiceCategory` classification.
- **Assistant description silently lost on save**: `upsertAssistant()` manually assembled the save object but omitted `description`, `avatar`, and `disabledSkills` fields — every save (including toggling an MCP server) discarded them. All three fields are now preserved. Added a `TextareaWithLabel` description input to `AssistantEditor` General tab so users can set the field directly from the UI.
- **AI agents unable to set assistant description via MCP tools**: `createAssistant` and `updateAssistant` MCP tool schemas were missing the `description` parameter entirely. Both schemas now declare the field.
- **Workspace file listing resilience**: Individual entry errors during directory listing are now handled gracefully instead of aborting the entire operation.
- **Assistant validation schema**: `disabledSkills` is now correctly recognized as an optional field, preventing spurious validation errors when loading existing assistants.

### 🔧 Internal

- **Workspace command decoupling**: Business logic extracted from monolithic `workspace_commands.rs` into `services::WorkspaceService` (file listing, override management) and `utils::terminal` (cross-platform terminal launch). Command handlers now hold zero domain logic.
- **`AgentChatMessages` hook extraction**: Scroll management and file-refetching logic split into dedicated `useChatScroll` and `useFileRefetcher` hooks, reducing component complexity.
- **`ErrorBubble` memoization**: Component memoized with a stable `onRetry` callback to prevent unnecessary re-renders in `AgentChatMessages`.
- **Deprecated `call_tool_unified` removed**: Cleaned up the deprecated unified tool routing path and duplicate MCP tool registrations.
- **Regression tests**: Added `#[test]` cases for `mcp_manager` core alias correctness, assistant tool schema completeness (`createAssistant`/`updateAssistant`), and assistant serialization round-trip field preservation.

## [0.5.13] - 2026-02-23

### 🚀 Features

- **Background Tool Loading Readiness Signal**: MCP servers now emit a readiness signal after background tool registration completes. HTTP client timeout extended to accommodate slower server startups, reducing false-negative tool-not-found errors when agents start immediately after session creation.

- **Agent Topology Controls**: `AgentSessionMetadata` gains `maxDepth` and `maxFanout` fields for fine-grained control over sub-agent spawning limits. `RustMessage` structure enhanced with additional fields for richer IPC payloads between frontend and backend.

- **Accessibility**: Added accessible labels to `ServerCard` action buttons, improving screen-reader support across the MCP server management UI.

- **Localization**: `AppSidebar`, `ThemeToggle`, and `ErrorBoundary` are now fully localized (Korean + English), closing the remaining hardcoded-string gaps in the main shell UI.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`ThrottlePromise` memory leak**: Multiple pending resolutions were not being flushed correctly, causing the queue to grow unbounded under rapid polling. Refactored to drain all waiting resolvers on each settled result.

- **Tool-level error silently reported as success**: `ToolExecutionResult.is_error` was derived only from the JSON-RPC protocol error field, meaning builtin tools that signal failure via `MCPResult.is_error` or `MCPContent::Text { is_error: Some(true) }` were emitting `ToolExecutionCompleted success=true`. Now checks all three failure signals.

### 🔧 Internal

- **`agent/llm/response.rs` fractal split**: The 1100-line response handler is split into three focused modules — `circuit_breaker.rs` (loop detection + tests), `tool_execution.rs` (sequential async tool dispatch), and the slimmed `response.rs` (orchestration only). No behavior change from the user's perspective.
- **Lazy `debug_content` serialization**: `serde_json::to_string_pretty` on tool results is now gated behind `log::log_enabled!(Debug)`, eliminating O(n) JSON serialization overhead on every tool call in release builds.
- **Agent IPC strict typing**: `agent_commands` optimized with strict TypeScript + Rust types — fewer `unknown` / `string` roundtrips across the IPC boundary.
- **Rate-limiting + session poll hints**: Session API rate-limiter improved with backoff hints for rapid-polling consumers.
- **MCP server management UI cleanup**: Removed stale dialog components superseded by the new MCP management flow.
- **Expanded test coverage**: `src/lib` utilities gain additional Vitest cases; `DroppedFileService` tests refactored with consistent formatting.

## [0.5.12] - 2026-02-22

### 🚀 Features

- **Blocking Process & Agent Waits (SP1)**: `waitForProcess` replaces the old polling-based `pollProcess` for long-running shell commands — agents now block on a `tokio::sync::Notify` and wake the instant the process finishes, eliminating redundant LLM round-trips and context-window bloat from status-polling loops. `awaitAgent` gains an indefinite-timeout mode (`timeout_seconds: 0`) for the same reason.

- **Max Concurrency Control (SP2)**: `ConcurrencyGate` enforces hard limits on parallel agent sessions (default: 4 active) and shell processes (default: 10). When a parent agent blocks on a child via `awaitAgent`, it suspends its active slot so the child can acquire one — preventing deadlocks. Limits are configurable in Settings → Advanced. Process completion now uses a push-notify system rather than fixed-interval polling.

- **Parent Session Cancel Isolation (SP6)**: Cancelling a parent session while it blocks waiting for a subagent now returns immediately instead of waiting up to 30 seconds for the next heartbeat. `cancel_workflow` fires a `SessionBus` notification on the parent's own bus entry; the `wait_until_session_terminal` loop subscribes to both the child and caller bus entries via a dual-notifier `tokio::select!`, so whichever fires first wins. Parent's concurrency slot is always released correctly even on the fast-cancel path.

- **Session Delete Options (SP7)**: Deleting a session with subagents now offers a choice instead of silently orphaning children:
  - **Delete all** — cascade-deletes the full descendant tree (BFS traversal).
  - **Delete only this** — removes the selected session and promotes its direct children to top-level sessions.
  - Single sessions (no children) see the original single-button confirm — no extra clicks.

### 🔧 Internal

- **Trace Analyzer Skill + `trace_dump.py`**: New dev tooling for analyzing agent session trace files — reports tool call frequency, concurrency patterns, and session outcomes directly from `.trace.json` files.
- **SP6 + SP7 Regression Tests**: `session_bus.rs` gains 4 `#[tokio::test]` cases covering dual-notifier wakeup, cancel flag short-circuit, and spurious-wake prevention. Frontend context tests add 4 Vitest cases covering BFS cascade removal and orphan promotion.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-02-22

### 🚀 Features

- **Playbook Server & Skills IPC**:
  - Added integration tests for PlaybookServer UI rendering and interaction flows.
  - Unified `SkillMetadata` type across frontend and backend for 1:1 parity with Rust.
  - Optimized `download_global_skills` Tauri command to stream download to file instead of memory.
  - Ported bundled skills from `dev/0.4.0` to `dev/0.5.x`.
- **Localization & Accessibility**: Localized MCP Server Management features (Korean and English) and enhanced a11y.
- **Performance**: Optimized `AgentToolCallGroup` rendering.
- **Security & Validation**: Enforced file size limits in `DocumentParser` and added validation tests for oversized files.
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded tests for date utils (locale-independent relative time) and retry utils.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **CSS Hierarchy**: Moved Pretendard `@import url()` before tailwindcss imports.
- **Cleanup**: Removed `download_global_skills` leftovers and related dead code from botched merge resolutions.
- **Test Mocks**: Made `toolResult` prop optional in `ToolCallCompactItem` test mock.

### 🔧 Internal

- **CI & Formatting**: Added Rust integration tests, improved CI workflow, and cleaned up code formatting in tools/tests for better readability.
- **Docs & Project Maintenance**:
  - Created `SECURITY.md`.
  - Added newline for better readability in Hermes's Journal.
  - Removed unused dependencies (`unit-prefix`) and bumped various versions (tempfile, indicatif, futures, uuid, tauri-plugin-http, regex, anyhow, docx-rs).

## [0.5.10] - 2026-02-21

### 🚀 Features

- **Browser `fetch` Tool**: New headless content extraction tool that lets agents fetch URLs and download files without opening a visible browser session — giving agents a lightweight scraping path alongside the existing interactive automation flow.

- **Declarative Builtin Service Registry**: `BUILTIN_SERVICE_REGISTRY` is now the single source of truth for all 12 builtin server names in both Rust (`agent/tools.rs`) and TypeScript (`runtime-builtins.ts`). Each server module declares `pub const NAME: &str` — the canonical name is defined exactly once and referenced everywhere, making name drift fail fast via regression tests rather than a silent routing failure.

- **Configurable Tool Call Detail Level**: Agent chat UI now supports user-selectable view modes for tool call rendering — Compact (simplified) and Developer (full arguments/results). Controlled per-session via settings.

- **Agent Start View Hub Layout**: Removed the inline session history panel from the start screen. Now a clean, centered assistant picker — history lives in the sidebar "Recent Sessions" and the dedicated History page where it belongs.

- **Assistant Card Redesign**: `AssistantSelectionCard` gets rounded-2xl corners, a dedicated icon badge, and a subtle lift-on-hover effect. More visual breathing room, clearer hierarchy.

- **Sidebar "See all sessions →"**: Recent Sessions section now has an explicit navigation item at the bottom of the list so users can reach the full History page without guessing.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Circuit breaker consecutive-failure count was off-by-one**: The break trigger was firing one iteration late because the counter included the current (unsent) call in its total. `evaluate_circuit_breaker_count` now returns the historical failure count only; the break fires as soon as `consecutive >= 2`, matching original intent.

- **`content_store` canonical name mismatch**: `ContentStoreServer::name()` was returning `"contentstore"` (no underscore), causing tool routing to silently fall back through the alias layer. Fixed to `"content_store"` — the alias system would have masked this forever without the new regression tests.

### 🔧 Internal

- **i18n Settings Coverage**: All `settings.*` and `common.*` keys used in the Settings page now have proper translations in both `en` and `ko` locales. Previously the entire Settings UI was falling back to hardcoded English strings regardless of language selection.

- **Circuit breaker refactored** (`agent/llm/response.rs`): Extracted `evaluate_circuit_breaker_count` from the pre-processing loop. `count_consecutive_failed_calls` is now generic over a predicate closure, covering both same-tool-name and same-signature (tool + args) detection without duplication. `build_tool_call_indices` builds both `call_name_by_id` and `call_signature_by_id` maps in a single pass.

- **Alias layer removed**: The entire builtin-service alias indirection has been eliminated. `canonicalize_builtin_service_alias` (Rust) and `canonicalizeAlias` (TypeScript) are now single-scan / O(1) Set lookups against the canonical name list. No more shadow name tables to keep in sync.

- **4 registry regression tests** added to `tests/builtin_service_registry_tests.rs` — `each_builtin_server_name_is_in_registry`, `builtin_server_names_are_unique`, `registry_has_no_duplicate_canonicals`, `registry_and_server_list_are_in_sync` — protecting against future name drift across all 12 builtin servers. Tests run in CI via `cargo test --tests`.

### 📚 Docs

- Updated `create-builtin-tool` SKILL.md with the `pub const NAME` pattern, three-point registration checklist (`BUILTIN_SERVICE_REGISTRY` + regression test update + `mod.rs` wiring), and expanded Quality Gates.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-02-21

### 🚀 Features

- **Configurable Tool Group Visibility in Agent Renderer**:
  - `AgentToolGroupBlock` now respects the user setting `toolCallGroupVisibleCount` instead of hardcoded display limits.
  - Preserves performance optimization from memoized tool-group rendering while restoring end-user control from Settings.

- **Timeout Behavior Controls for MCP Execution**:
  - Added support to disable MCP tool execution timeout by default.
  - Added UI status indicator to make timeout mode visible to users.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **MCP Server Management Accessibility**:
  - Fixed install action semantics in preset cards with explicit button interaction wiring.
  - Added unique, descriptive `aria-label` text for environment variable/header removal buttons.
  - Removed duplicate `aria-label` attributes introduced during prior edits.

- **Database Backup Integrity in WAL Mode**:
  - Backup flow now uses SQLite `VACUUM INTO` for consistent snapshot behavior in WAL mode.
  - Eliminates risk of incomplete backups from plain file-copy approaches.

- **Workspace/Browser Tool Guidance Corrections**:
  - Browser `content` guidance strings updated to current parameter format.
  - Workspace `replaceLines` documentation clarified to match actual append behavior constraints.

- **Secure File Manager Size-Limit Enforcement**:
  - Hardened append-path size checks to prevent overflow-based file-size-limit bypass.
  - Added dedicated integration tests for append-limit scenarios.

### ⚡ Performance

- **Agent Chat Rendering Optimizations**:
  - Reduced unnecessary re-renders in `AgentMessageRenderer`, `AgentMessageBubble`, `ToolCallCompactItem`, and tool group components.
  - Memoization/comparator improvements lower UI work during streaming and tool-heavy sessions.

### 🔧 Internal

- Refactored agent LLM layer into focused submodules (`completion`, `prompt`, `response`, `types`) for maintainability.
- Refactored interactive browser server into cleaner modular structure.
- Removed obsolete lifecycle unit tests blocked by current crate test configuration and aligned lifecycle code cleanup.

### 📚 Docs

- Synced `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `agents.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` with current architecture and MCP behavior.
- Updated builtin-tool documentation and internal project notes to reduce docs drift.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-02-20

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Crash recovery: child agent session stuck as "paused" forever**: After a crash/restart, child agent sessions that were mid-execution would remain paused indefinitely and never resume. The awaitAgent tool now correctly resumes paused sessions through a new `POST /api/sessions/:id/resume` endpoint — no garbage messages are injected into the session history.
- **Session history list not reflecting live status**: The start-view session card list was not updating when a child session transitioned from `paused` to `busy` during crash recovery. The `AgentSessionListContext` now subscribes directly to `statusChanged` events and patches session status in-place without a full reload.
- **Garbage `[system] Resume after crash recovery.` message in child session**: The previous recovery mechanism injected a fake user message via `POST /messages`, polluting the session history and the LLM context. The new `/resume` endpoint triggers workflow continuation from existing messages without adding any new message.
- **"Session not found" on crash recovery kick**: Paused sessions at startup were not loaded into `active_sessions` memory, causing `/messages` POST to fail. The new `/resume` endpoint calls `resume_session` first (loads session into memory, recreates MCP proxy) before triggering the workflow.
- **Stale "Busy" in-memory status after crash recovery**: `recover_sessions` was inserting a stale `Busy` metadata snapshot for newly-recovered sessions, causing the next `start_workflow` call to see a busy session and silently queue rather than run.
- **Orphaned tool call spinners after crash**: Tool calls that were in-flight at crash time left the UI with permanently spinning tool result indicators. Crash recovery now injects tombstone error results for all unresolved tool calls, allowing the UI to unblock.

### 🔧 Internal

- New `POST /api/sessions/:id/resume` HTTP endpoint (`resume_session_workflow` handler) that loads a session into memory and resumes the LLM workflow from existing message history.
- `recover_sessions` explicitly sets `SessionStatus::Paused` on recovered metadata in both "new entry" and "already active" branches to prevent status snapshot race conditions.
- `last_message_is_ui_resource()` helper in `formatting.rs` distinguishes intentional UI-pause (awaiting user interaction) from crash-pause, preventing spurious resume kicks on sessions waiting for a UI resource response.
- Recovery tombstone messages tagged with `source: "recovery"` and filtered out from LLM context in `llm.rs` to avoid confusing the model.
- Added 7 TypeScript unit tests for `statusChanged` in-place patching and 9 Rust unit tests for `last_message_is_ui_resource` / `is_terminal_status` in `formatting.rs`.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-02-20

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Agent restart after cancel**: Fixed regression where cancelling an agent session permanently blocked subsequent messages. The workflow state machine now unconditionally resets the cancellation token on `start_workflow`, enabling cancel-then-continue as intended.
- **LLM abort error detection**: `isAbortError` utility now correctly identifies `DOMException`-based abort errors (not just `Error` subclasses), preventing false `error` status transitions after user-initiated cancellation in all browser environments.
- **Session status on abort**: Cancelled LLM requests now correctly transition session status to `idle` instead of `error`.

### 🔧 Internal

- Extracted shared `isAbortError()` utility from duplicated inline detection in `useLLMExecution` and `useLLMListener`.
- Added comprehensive cancel state machine test suite: 13 Rust integration tests (`tests/cancel_logic.rs`) + 20 TypeScript unit tests (`cancel.test.ts`).
- Rust cancel tests moved to integration test binary to avoid `STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND` DLL errors on Windows.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-02-20

### 🚀 Features

- **MCP Server Presets**:
  - New `MCPServerManagement` panel with curated preset catalog — one-click install for popular MCP servers (GitHub, Brave Search, Filesystem, etc.).
  - `MCPServerDialog` now supports preset selection, variable substitution UI, and environment variable definitions.
  - Backend `presets.rs` embeds `mcp-server.json` at compile time for zero-cost preset resolution.
  - Dedicated `/mcp-servers` route and sidebar nav entry.

- **Database Lifecycle Robustness**:
  - WAL journal mode enabled by default for improved write throughput and crash safety (`SqliteJournalMode::Wal`).
  - New `MigrationVerifier`: SHA-256 checksums over migration file list detect schema drift before startup.

- **Browser Tools — Playwright-Style Aliases**:
  - Short-name aliases now exposed: `goto`, `click`, `fill`, `type`, `content`, `back`, `forward`, `scroll`.
  - `content` is a smart router: no args → extract fresh page content; `page` arg → read from cache. Replaces both `extractWebContent` and `readWebContent`.
  - `create_rich_response`: all success paths now return live page title + URL as post-action verification.
  - `suggest_selectors`: element-not-found errors now auto-suggest up to 5 visible candidate selectors from the live DOM.
  - `all_tools()` now exposes the curated Playwright-style set only; legacy names remain routed for backward compatibility.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`navigate_to_url` HTTP error routing**:
  - HTTP 403/401/404/5xx/timeout/Network Error responses now return targeted, action-specific guidance instead of silently passing through to `create_rich_response`.

- **`invalidate_cache` double write lock**:
  - Removed duplicate `state_cache.write()` call in `BrowserServer::invalidate_cache()`.

- **Browser tool description stale names**:
  - `click_element_tool` schema and `extract_web_content_tool` description corrected to reference `content` instead of old names.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-02-20

- **Browser Tools — Playwright-Style Aliases**:
  - Short-name aliases now exposed: `goto`, `click`, `fill`, `type`, `content`, `back`, `forward`, `scroll`.
  - `content` is a smart router: no args → extract fresh page content; `page` arg → read from cache. Replaces both `extractWebContent` and `readWebContent`.
  - `create_rich_response`: all success paths now return live page title + URL as post-action verification, so agents can confirm the action result without an extra call.
  - `suggest_selectors`: element-not-found errors now auto-suggest up to 5 visible candidate selectors from the live DOM.
  - `all_tools()` now exposes the curated Playwright-style set only; legacy names remain routed for backward compatibility.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`navigate_to_url` HTTP error routing**:
  - HTTP 403/401/404/5xx/timeout/Network Error responses now return targeted, action-specific guidance (e.g., "Abandon this page" for 403) instead of silently passing through to `create_rich_response`.

- **`invalidate_cache` double write lock**:
  - Removed duplicate `state_cache.write()` call in `BrowserServer::invalidate_cache()` — redundant re-lock after first guard was dropped.

- **Browser tool description stale names**:
  - `click_element_tool` schema description still referenced `extractWebContent`; `extract_web_content_tool` description still referenced `readWebContent(page)`. Both corrected to `content`.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-19

### 🚀 Features

- **Migration & Cascade Deletes**:
  - Restored missing database migrations and cascade delete logic that were lost during a prior merge.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-17

### 🧠 Performance & Decision Quality (The "Orchestrator" Update)

- **Assistant Discovery Optimization**:
  - Enhanced `listAssistants`, `searchAssistant`, and `getAssistant` to include resolved **Skills** summaries.
  - Automatically resolves cryptic MCP server IDs into human-readable names (e.g., `google-search`) in the skill list, helping orchestrator agents (MasterMind) make faster decisions.

- **Intelligent Caching**:
  - Implemented a thread-safe, 30-second TTL cache for the server name map.
  - Eliminates redundant database hits during recursive assistant lookups while maintaining data freshness.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-16

### 🧘 Mental Clarity & Safety (The "Soul" Update)

- **Terminology Unification**:
  - Renamed `listExternalServers` → **`listServers`** (Simplified)
  - Renamed `listInternalTools` → **`listBuiltinTools`** (Clarified)
  - Merged `searchServer` into `listServers` (via `query` param)

- **Safety First (HashLine)**:

  - `searchLineInFile` now returns **content hash** (`a1b2`) along with text, enabling immediate safe edits.

- **Tool Diet**:
  - Hidden deprecated tools: `editFile`, `editFileMulti`, `searchServer`.
  - Minified tool descriptions to save context tokens.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-14

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Session Lineage Grouping (Start View)**:
  - Fixed a regression where clicking a session card's lineage focus could hide the parent while showing only child sessions.
  - Root cause: some sessions were created without normalized `lineageId`, causing lineage filtering mismatch between parent and child records.
  - Backend now normalizes lineage defaults during session creation (`lineageId` falls back to `sessionId` for roots, `parentSessionId` for children when missing).
  - Frontend session list normalization now backfills missing lineage/depth values for legacy records so parent/child lineage focus remains stable.

### ✅ Validation

- Re-ran API E2E flow via `scripts/test_api.py` after fix:
  - session create/resume/message polling,
  - parent-child lineage checks,
  - `maxDepth` limit behavior,
  - `maxFanout` limit behavior.
- Result: all scenarios passed.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-14

- **Workspace Cleanup Robustness**: Added graceful shutdown behavior for background cleanup tasks to avoid leaked loops on teardown.

### ✅ Tests

- Added unit tests for:
  - tool-result classification (`accept / stale / duplicate`),

## LibrAgent Changelog (2025.01 ~ 2025.11 요약)

### ✨ 신규 기능 (Features)

- **AI 에이전트 기능 확장**
  - AI 서비스(`OpenAI`, `Anthropic` 등) 호출 시 `forceToolUse` 옵션을 추가하여, 모델이 반드시 도구를 사용하도록 강제하는 기능을 구현했습니다.
  - 에이전트가 런타임에 MCP 서버를 직접 관리(검색, 생성, 연결)할 수 있도록 `mcp_manager` 내장 도구를 추가했습니다. 이 도구는 BM25 기반 검색을 지원합니다.
- **비동기 프로세스 관리 (Workspace)**
  - `execute_shell` 도구에 `async` (비동기) 실행 모드를 추가했습니다. 이를 통해 서버 시작, 빌드, 파일 감시 등 장시간 실행되는 명령어를 백그라운드에서 실행하고 즉시 제어권을 반환받을 수 있습니다.
  - 비동기 프로세스를 모니터링하기 위한 도구 3종 (`poll_process`, `read_process_output`, `list_processes`)을 추가했습니다.
  - 에이전트가 `poll_process`를 과도하게(예: 5회 연속) 호출하는 패턴을 감지하고, 더 효율적인 폴링 전략(예: 대기 시간 증가)을 제안하는 가이드 시스템을 도입했습니다.
- **UI 상호작용 도구 (Agent-User)**
  - 에이전트가 사용자에게 명시적인 "계속" 확인을 요청할 수 있는 `wait_for_user_resume` 도구를 추가했습니다.
  - 에이전트가 사용자에게 텍스트 입력, 객관식 선택(`prompt_user`)을 요청하거나 데이터를 시각화(`visualize_data`)할 수 있는 `ui-tools` 모듈을 구현했습니다.
- **데이터 및 검색**
  - 메시지 저장소를 기존 프론트엔드 IndexedDB에서 백엔드 SQLite로 이전하여 데이터 관리 및 검색을 중앙화했습니다.
  - Rust 백엔드에 BM25 기반의 전역 메시지 검색 기능을 도입했습니다.
  - 'History' 페이지에 전역 메시지 검색 UI를 추가했습니다. 이제 검색 결과(히트 수)를 기반으로 관련성이 높은 세션을 우선 정렬할 수 있습니다.
- **코어 시스템**
  - Web Worker (MCP)에서 발생한 DB 변경 사항(예: `mcp_manager`로 서버 생성)을 React UI로 즉시 전파하는 실시간 이벤트 알림 시스템을 구축했습니다.
  - 단일 세션 내에서 여러 독립적인 대화 맥락을 관리할 수 있도록 `threadId` 기반의 메시지 그룹핑 기능을 도입했습니다.

---

### 🚀 아키텍처 개선 (Architecture & Refactoring)

- **Stateless 아키텍처로 전환 (핵심 변경)**
  - 기존 `switch_context`에 의존하던 stateful 아키텍처를 전면 폐기했습니다.
  - 이제 모든 도구 호출 시 `__sessionId`, `__assistantId`, `__threadId` 등 컨텍스트 정보를 파라미터로 명시적으로 전달하여, 동시 요청(concurrent request) 안정성을 확보하고 Race Condition을 원천 차단합니다.
- **데이터베이스 (Backend)**
  - Rust 백엔드의 모든 SQLx 직접 호출을 **Repository Pattern**으로 추상화했습니다. 이를 통해 데이터 접근 로직을 중앙화하고, 테스트 용이성(Mocking) 및 유지보수성을 대폭 향상시켰습니다.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
  - **설정 분리**: `Assistant` 모델이 `mcpConfig` 전체를 포함하던 구조를 리팩토링했습니다. 이제 MCP 서버는 중앙 DB에서 관리되며, Assistant는 `mcpServerIds` 배열(참조)만 갖도록 변경하여 설정 중복을 제거하고 관리를 용이하게 했습니다.
  - **공식 스펙 준수**: 기존 `stdio` 전용 MCP 설정을 HTTP/SSE Transport 및 OAuth 2.1 인증을 지원하는 공식 스펙으로 마이그레이션했습니다.
  - **메타데이터 분산**: `WebMCPServiceRegistry`에 하드코딩되어 있던 서버 메타데이터(표시 이름, 설명 등)를 각 서버 모듈이 직접 소유하도록 분산시켰습니다.
  - **도구 분리**: `playbook-store`의 `list_playbooks` (AI용 텍스트)와 `show_playbooks` (사용자용 UI) 도구를 분리하여 에이전트의 자율적 실행을 보장하고 페이지네이션을 추가했습니다.
- **AI 서비스**
  - Anthropic 서비스의 모델 목록을 정적 config 파일이 아닌, SDK API를 통해 동적으로 로드하도록 개선하여 최신 모델을 자동으로 지원합니다.
- **코드 모듈화**
  - `mcp-types.ts` (700+ 라인) 파일을 도메인별(protocol, config, schema, utils 등) 여러 모듈로 분리했습니다.
  - `playbook-store.ts`, `planning-server.ts` 등 1000라인이 넘는 대형 모듈들을 책임별 서브모듈로 분리하여 복잡도를 낮췄습니다.
- **성능 최적화**
  - 과도한 React Context 중첩 구조를 단순화하고, 스크롤 이벤트에 `throttle`, 검색 입력에 `debounce`를 적용하여 전반적인 앱 응답성을 개선했습니다.

### 🐛 버그 수정 (Fixes)

- **Windows 호환성 (Critical)**
  - Windows 환경에서 파일 드래그 앤 드롭 import가 실패하던 경로 파싱 문제(Unix `/` vs Windows `\`)를 해결했습니다.
  - 플랫폼별로 `execute_shell`(Unix)과 `execute_windows_cmd`(Windows)로 도구 이름을 분리하여 명령어 실행 호환성을 확보했습니다.
- **AI 서비스**
  - OpenAI API에서 `tool_calls`와 `tool` 응답 메시지의 순서가 맞지 않아 발생하던 400 에러를 해결하기 위해 Tool Call Pairing 검증 로직을 추가했습니다.

### 🎨 UI/UX 개선 (UI/UX)

- Agent 응답 메시지 UI를 기존의 말풍선 형태에서 ChatGPT와 같이 전체 너비를 사용하는 Rich Display 형식으로 변경했습니다.
- 긴 코드 블록이나 텍스트가 UI 영역을 벗어나던(overflow) 문제를 해결하고, 가로 스크롤바를 제공하도록 수정했습니다.
- 모든 코드 블록에 **Syntax Highlighting**을 적용하여 가독성을 높였습니다.
- Agent가 응답을 생성 중일 때, 단순 "thinking..." 텍스트 대신 애니메이션 효과가 포함된 로딩 UI를 표시하도록 개선했습니다.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-10

### Added

- **Interactive Shell Execution with User Prompts (Zero-Knowledge Architecture)** - [Refactoring Plan](docs/history/refactoring_20251115_1430.md)
  - Added `require_user_input` parameter to `execute_shell` tool for requesting user input before command execution
  - Implemented secure password handling via direct Tauri command (`execute_with_user_input`)
  - **Security**: User input (passwords) NEVER appears in MCP requests/responses or logs
  - **Architecture**: Frontend → Tauri IPC (encrypted) → Backend execution, bypassing MCP protocol entirely
  - Supports password (hidden) and text (visible) input types with UIResource-based prompt UI
  - Automatic sudo detection and password prompt generation
  - Pending execution state management with timeout protection (5 minutes)
  - Use cases: sudo commands, interactive scripts, confirmation prompts
  - Password is cleared from memory immediately after execution
  - See detailed implementation plan and security analysis in refactoring document

### Breaking Changes

- **Platform-specific shell execution tool names**:
  - Windows: `execute_shell` renamed to `execute_windows_cmd` to clarify cmd.exe usage
  - Unix: `execute_shell` remains unchanged (bash/sh)
  - This change improves tool naming clarity and prevents cross-platform confusion
  - Tool descriptions and examples are now platform-specific
  - **Migration**: Update any hardcoded tool name references from `execute_shell` to `execute_windows_cmd` on Windows

### Highlights

- Cross-platform build support with Windows target compilation from Linux
- Enhanced release automation via GitHub Actions
- Multi-platform binary distribution (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-11

### Highlights

- Improved History UX and search plumbing (global message search aggregation, session-level hit counts).
- Introduced built-in WebMCP UI tools for interactive prompts and small visualizations (prompt_user, reply_prompt, visualize_data).
- Backend message persistence improvements: groundwork for SQLite-backed message storage and Tauri commands for message CRUD.
- BM25 search integration planning and initial index metadata handling; session index cleanup implemented to remove orphaned index files.

### Added

- WebMCP UI tools (built-in): `prompt_user`, `reply_prompt`, `visualize_data`.
  - HTML-based UI resources returned as multipart MCP responses to enable interactive in-chat UI flows.
  - Worker and module registry updated to include `ui` server module.
- History search improvements:
  - `searchMessages` Tauri wrapper added to `rust-backend-client` (client-side wrappers and SWR integration).
  - Frontend aggregates message search results into session-level summaries (count, latest timestamp, snippet) for the History view.
- Session index cleanup: backend now removes BM25 index files and index metadata when sessions are deleted (reduces disk bloat).
- Sidebar & UI polish:
  - Removed legacy "Message Search (BM25)" sidebar item and unified History link to `/history`.
  - Added keyboard shortcut to toggle the sidebar (Ctrl+B).

### Changed / Improved

- Message persistence plan and tooling:
  - Added design and initial server/client commands for message pagination and upsert (Tauri commands: `messages_get_page`, `messages_upsert`, etc.).
  - Frontend `SessionHistoryContext` prepared to switch from IndexedDB optimistic persistence to backend SQLite persistence.
- BM25 search architecture documented and partially implemented:
  - Index metadata schema (`message_index_meta`) introduced to track index_path, last_indexed_at and doc_count.
  - Background reindex worker design (dirty tracking, incremental reindex) included.
- Playbook / UIResource improvements: multipart responses (text + UIResource) are used for richer tool results (playbook lists, interactive UI).

### Fixed

- Removed the unused `MessageSearch.tsx` and cleaned up related imports.
- Linting/formatting and build fixes discovered during validation.

### Notes & Next Steps

- Run the full validation pipeline before publishing: `pnpm refactor:validate` (lint, format, rust checks, build, dead-code).
- Remaining work planned for 0.1.x:
  - Finalize SQLite message persistence and production-safe migration from IndexedDB.
  - Implement `messages_search` Tauri command and BM25 index manager (load/save/search).
  - Add tests for message CRUD, search, and index persistence.
  - Consider adding a compact release note/summary to the top of `README.md`.
