# Sub-agents & orchestration

> A session can spawn **child sessions (sub-agents)** to split work.  
> Pick a pattern with bundled **orchestration skills**.

## What is a sub-agent?

|                   | Meaning                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Is**            | A **child session** created by the parent (e.g. via `agent__spawnSession`). Parent–child **lineage** is kept.  |
| **Is not**        | A clone of the parent runtime. Workspace, local skills, and `agents.md` are **not** copied automatically.      |
| **Who drives it** | Usually you attach `@skill:delegate` (etc.) so the agent manages spawn / poll / merge — not manual tool calls. |

Parents should first inspect existing children for a suitable **Idle session with the same assistant configuration** and reuse it with `messageToSession` when possible. When no suitable session exists, or a different role, parallel work, or isolated workspace is needed, they **start → poll/`checkSession` → correct with `messageToSession` → merge results**.
Sibling sessions do not talk to each other (the parent hub relays).

### Where it shows in the UI

| Screen                   | Content                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Chat / History**       | Child count on the session card. On delete: **with sub-agents** vs **keep children** |
| Sidebar **Org** (`/org`) | **Explicit orgs** only. One-off delegation sessions do **not** appear here           |

## Isolation rules

Children use their **own workspace** by default.

- Workspace guidance (`agents.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `GEMINI.md`) and workspace skills are read **on the child**.
- **Assistant**-scoped skills follow the assistant chosen for the child.
- **Global** skills are available to parent and child.
- To share a folder, skills/agents set `workspaceOverride` (not an automatic copy).
- `messageToSession(reset=true)` clears the previous conversation, planning, pending messages, and runtime state but does not delete workspace files. It also closes the browser session, so use `reset=false` when browser state must be preserved.

If the child “assumes” parent-only files, local `skills/`, or workspace rules, delegation fails. Put **goal, scope, output format, required paths** in the handoff, or use a shared workspace / `workspaceOverride`.

Tool names and troubleshooting: follow the bundled `@skill:delegate` body.

## Which skill when?

Mention `@skill:name` or tell the agent the pattern name.

### 1) One-shot delegation · basics

| Skill          | When                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`delegate`** | Create / watch / nudge children and workspace isolation — **baseline** for other patterns |
| **`recruit`**  | Create a new **specialist assistant config** (not session delegation itself)              |
| **`boost`**    | Trim / strengthen tools on an **existing** assistant                                      |

```
@skill:delegate
Read only the auth module in this repo and summarize vulnerability candidates in Markdown.
```

### 2) Work-splitting patterns (ephemeral children)

| Skill                      | Pattern        | One line                                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **`divide-conquer`**       | Parallel split | Non-overlapping pieces → merge                       |
| **`hub-spoke`**            | Hub–spoke      | Coordinator steers workers; no worker-to-worker chat |
| **`pipeline`**             | Sequential     | A output → B input → C …                             |
| **`consensus-delegation`** | Multi-view     | Same question to 2–4 experts → parent reconciles     |
| **`gatekeeper`**           | Quality gate   | Creator ↔ Reviewer loop (retry limit)               |
| **`pair-programming`**     | Pair           | Driver / Navigator on a **shared workspace**         |

```
@skill:divide-conquer
Split frontend, backend, and docs review reports in parallel, then merge into one.
```

```
@skill:consensus-delegation
Review this PR from security, performance, and maintainability angles and reconcile opinions.
```

### 3) Persistent teams · Org

Different from one-off delegation. Use when you need **team artifacts** and **Org UX**.

| Skill                 | Role                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`teamwork`**        | Scaffold task force, artifact dirs, coordination model — **prepare first**               |
| **`org`**             | After `agent__createOrg`, member sessions appear under Org. Resume from the **Org root** |
| **`org-restructure`** | Add/trim roles or edit charters (`agents.md`, …) on an existing Org                      |

Flow: `teamwork` scaffold → `org` create/spawn → resume from sidebar **Org** → change structure with `org-restructure`.

- **Org** ≠ scheduled automation (`schedule`) ≠ in-session reminders (`session-schedule`)
- Plain parent–child delegation alone does **not** show under **Org**

```
@skill:teamwork
Create a research / implement / review task force and coordinate with hub-spoke.
```

## Tips

1. **Smallest structure first** — do not build a team if one agent is enough.
2. **Self-contained handoffs** — children should not guess parent chat.
3. **Async spawn by default** — for parallelism, skills often use `waitForResult=false`.
4. **Verify child output** — paths, scope, missing workspace rules — before the final answer.
5. **On delete** — choose whether to include sub-agents ([Sessions](sessions.md)).
